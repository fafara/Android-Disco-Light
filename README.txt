WORK IN PROGRESS:

Imagine you've organized a party, and everything is great, including the music, but the lights are a little boring, and you don't want to go all the way with a dedicated light installation. If only all the Android phone users would be able to coordinate their flash LEDs to synchronize with the playing beat, that would be awesome!

This program will resolve this issue and therefore provide more awesomeness for your parties.

The input will be the microphone, and the audio data will be processed (maybe recognized from a database) and the LED will light on and off as needed, on the rhythm.

The program will also allow the selection of certain frequencies (for instance one would activate when voices are detected while another tends to the base only, which are lower frequencies)
