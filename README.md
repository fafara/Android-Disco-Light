#Android Disco Light

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Imagine you've organized a party, and everything is great, including the music, but the lights are a little boring
and you don't want to go all the way with a dedicated light installation. If only all the Android phone users
would be able to coordinate their flash LEDs to synchronize with the playing beat, that would be awesome!
This program will resolve this issue and therefore provide more awesomeness for your parties.

**Features:**
  - You can select which frequencies the app will work with.
  - The app can work with a network of phones.
  
**Dependencies:**
  - Java 1.8 (It may work on older versions too.)
  - At least one phone with a working microphone and with Android

**License:** Not chosen yet. For now, you can use the software for free, but without distribuiting it or a modification of it.
